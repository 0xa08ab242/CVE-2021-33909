# Sequoia (CVE-2021-33909)
## Building
```shell
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
```
## Running
```shell
chmod +x exploit
./exploit
```
## One-Liner
```shell
gcc exploit.c -o exploit;chmod +x exploit;./exploit
```
## Conflicting Instructions
The instructions are wrong on this one. 
```./exploit``` needs to be run with a directory path (as they did it in the PoC) ```mkdir dir;./exploit $(pwd)/dir```
